## DEA
Folder `DEA` consists of files used for Data Exploratory Analysis - becoming familiar with the data.

## NN
Folder `NN` consists of `Neural Network from Scratch` playbook where a neural network written in Numpy is used for classification.

The data is located in folder data/processed. It should be downloaded locally.
The data is not a part of the GitHub repository, hence the /data line in .gitignore.
